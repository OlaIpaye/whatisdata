### Objective
Explore Data Engineering like a 5 year old!

# What Is Data?
Data is like a **toy box** where each toy is a piece of information, some neatly organized (structured), some messy (unstructured), some broken (dirty), and **a data engineerâ€™s job is to organize it so everything is easy to find**.

## Practical Exercise
Check out the toys.py file for visual example.
